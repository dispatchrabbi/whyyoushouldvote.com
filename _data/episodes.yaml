    In this first official episode, Eli and Sonia take you through the basic structure of the federal government. We describe each of the three branches and how they interact, as well as who belongs in each branch. We also talk about what each branch controls, who you vote for and who is appointed, and how subsections of the three main branches work.
  notes: |
    A quick correction: in this episode, we said that the President appoints secretaries, diplomats, and justices, and the Senate confirms them. Technically, the President *nominates* people for those positions and then the Senate confirms them.

  title: State Governments

    In this episode Eli and Sonia provide you with an overview of state governments. We couldn’t do every single state individually, but we give a broad sketch of what most state governments look like. We also describe federalism and how it works, with a couple of examples to provide some clarity.
  notes: |
    A quick clarification: in this episode we unintentionally implied that the U.S. Postal Service is not an agency. This is incorrect! The USPS is an independent agency under the Executive branch. However, the Constitution also explicitly gives the Federal Government the power to establish post offices and post roads, which is why it’s a federal agency rather than run by states.

We’ll go through a list of common suppression techniques, and focus on one specific case to give you an idea of the true scope of the problem.

We cover the pros and cons of voting in person, voting early, and voting by mail, and why all three methods are important. (And we list several ways you cannot vote.) Finally, we detail how the vote is counted, audited, and certified, and how news outlets are able to call elections on Election Day even before that count finishes.
