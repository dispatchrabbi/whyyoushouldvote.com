We also talk about what each branch controls, who you vote for and who is appointed, and how subsections of the three main branches work.</p>
</section>
  <section class="notes margin-2">
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>A quick correction: in this episode, we said that the President appoints secretaries, diplomats, and justices, and the Senate confirms them. Technically, the President <em>nominates</em> people for those positions and then the Senate confirms them.</p>

  <section class="summary margin-2"><p>In this episode Eli and Sonia provide you with an overview of state governments. We couldn’t do every single state individually, but we give a broad sketch of what most state governments look like. We also describe federalism and how it works, with a couple of examples to provide some clarity.</p>
</section>
  <section class="notes margin-2">
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>A quick clarification: in this episode we unintentionally implied that the U.S. Postal Service is not an agency. This is incorrect! The USPS is an independent agency under the Executive branch. However, the Constitution also explicitly gives the Federal Government the power to establish post offices and post roads, which is why it’s a federal agency rather than run by states.</p>

    <p>Why You Should Vote is a show about helping people learn why and how to vote. We want every single citizen to exercise their right to vote, and we want them to walk into the voting booth informed about both the candidates they're voting for and the system that they're participating in. Why You Should Vote is one part civics lesson and one part how-to guide: the missing manual for voters.</p>
    <p>The hosts, Eli and Sonia, are not historians, political scientists, or community organizers. We're just a couple of nerdy citizens who had to learn this complicated system for ourselves and have spent time explaining it to others in the hopes that they go vote. And now we're explaining it to you.</p>
